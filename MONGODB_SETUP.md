# MongoDB Atlas Setup (Required for Deployment)

This guide is specifically for setting up MongoDB Atlas for your Render + Vercel deployment.

## Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### 1. Create MongoDB Atlas Account
- Go to https://cloud.mongodb.com
- Sign up for a free account

### 2. Create a Cluster
- Click "Build a Database"
- Choose "FREE" tier (M0)
- Select your preferred cloud provider and region
- Click "Create"

### 3. Set Up Database Access
- Go to "Database Access" in the left sidebar
- Click "Add New Database User"
- Create a username and password (save these!)
- Select "Read and write to any database"
- Click "Add User"

### 4. Set Up Network Access
- Go to "Network Access" in the left sidebar
- Click "Add IP Address"
- Click "Allow Access from Anywhere" (for development)
- Click "Confirm"

### 5. Get Your Connection String
- Go to "Database" in the left sidebar
- Click "Connect"
- Choose "Connect your application"
- Copy the connection string

### 6. Update Your Environment Variables

**For Local Development:**
Create `.env` file in the `server` directory:
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/todoboard
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
PORT=5000
```

**For Render Deployment:**
Add these environment variables in your Render dashboard:
- `MONGODB_URI` = your_atlas_connection_string
- `JWT_SECRET` = your-secret-key
- `CLIENT_URL` = your-vercel-frontend-url

## Testing the Connection

1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Look for success message:**
   ```
   âœ… Connected to MongoDB successfully!
   ```

## Common Issues

### "Authentication Failed"
- Check username/password in connection string
- Ensure user has "Read and write to any database" permissions

### "Network Timeout"
- Verify "Allow Access from Anywhere" is enabled in Network Access
- Check your internet connection

### "Invalid Connection String"
- Make sure to replace `<password>` with your actual password
- Ensure the database name is correct (e.g., `/todoboard`)

## Quick Fix

If you're having issues, double-check:
1. âœ… MongoDB Atlas cluster is created
2. âœ… Database user exists with proper permissions
3. âœ… Network access allows connections from anywhere
4. âœ… Connection string is copied correctly
5. âœ… Environment variables are set in Render

That's it! Your MongoDB Atlas setup is complete for deployment. ðŸš€
